/* 
Important configuration notes:

The configuration is interpreted from top to bottom, unlike in IRCds that use
the colon-delimited configuration block format.

Some blocks must be listed before other types of blocks.

  class{}; must go before auth{}; and connect{}; blocks. More specific
auth{);s will be occluded if they occur after more general ones.
  privset{}; must go before oper{};.

#Shell comments are supported.

// Extensions
/* ircd-chatd has a number of extensions that are not enabled by default
 * (but really should be). They're listed below, with suggested ones uncommented
 *
 * Emulates channel mode +-O (oper only) (+-iI $o)   -- chm_operonly_compat.so
 * Emulates channel mode +-R (quiet unreg) (+-q $~a) -- chm_quietunreg_compat.so
 * Emulates channel mode +-S (ssl only) (+-b $~z)    -- chm_sslonly_compat.so

 * Not recommended for normal networks:
 * Restrict channel creation to logged in users      -- createauthonly.so
 * Opers cannot be invisible (disables +i for +oO)   -- no_oper_invis.so

 * Extbans:
 * Account bans (+b $a[:mask])                       -- extb_account.so
 * Banned from another channel (+b $j:mask)          -- extb_canjoin.so
 * Other-channel bans (+b $c:mask)                   -- extb_channel.so
 * Extended ban (+b $x:mask)                         -- extb_extgecos.so
 * Oper bans (+b $o)                                 -- extb_oper.so
 * Realname (gecos) bans (+b $r:mask)                -- extb_realname.so
 * Server bans (+b $s:mask)                          -- extb_server.so
 * SSL bans, with fingerprint (+b $z[:fingerprint])  -- extb_ssl_fp.so

 * Useful utilities:
 * Unrealish host-mangling (umode +x, configurable)  -- ip_cloaking_5.so
 * Find channel forwards                             -- m_findforwards.so
 * /identify support                                 -- m_identify.so
 * Far connection notices (snomask +F)               -- sno_farconnect.so
 * Remote k/d/x line active notices                  -- sno_globalkline.so
 * Remote oper up notices                            -- sno_globaloper.so
 * /whois notifications (snomask +W)                 -- sno_whois.so
 * Oper-override (modehacking only)                  -- override.so
 * override.so is required for oper:netadmin modehacking to work.
 *
 * Deprecated:
 * SSL bans (+b $z)                                  -- extb_ssl.so
 * Channel mode +-A (admin only)                     -- chm_adminonly.so
